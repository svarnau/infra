It sends codes from codes.csv to ATCs in atc.csv and outputs a csv file
with which name corresponds to which code.

You use it like this:

- Copy settings.py.sample to settings.py
- Update values in settings.py, especially EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_FROM,
EMAIL_SIGNATURE and EMAIL_PASSWORD
- Run a test with "python send.py atc_sample.csv codes_sample.csv"

Should work on stock Ubuntu. 

When ready, run the real thing with:

$ python send.py atc.csv codes.csv > sent.csv
