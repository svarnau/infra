System Administration
#####################

Our infrastructure is code and contributions to it are handled just
like the rest of OpenStack.  This means that anyone can contribute to
the installation and long-running maintenance of systems without shell
access, and anyone who is interested can provide feedback and
collaborate on code reviews.

The configuration of every system operated by the infrastructure team
is managed by Puppet in a single Git repository:

  https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/config

All system configuration should be encoded in that repository so that
anyone may propose a change in the running configuration to Gerrit.

Making a Change in Puppet
=========================

Many changes to the Puppet configuration can safely be made while only
performing syntax checks.  Some more complicated changes merit local
testing and an interactive development cycle.  The config repo is
structured to facilitate local testing before proposing a change for
review.  This is accomplished by separating the puppet configuration
into several layers with increasing specificity about site
configuration higher in the stack.

The `modules/` directory holds puppet modules that abstractly describe
the configuration of a service.  Ideally, these should have no
OpenStack-specific information in them, and eventually they should all
become modules that are directly consumed from PuppetForge, only
existing in the config repo during an initial incubation period.  This
is not yet the case, so you may find OpenStack-specific configuration
in these modules, though we are working to reduce it.

The `modules/openstack_project/manifests/` directory holds
configuration for each of the servers that the OpenStack project runs.
Think of these manifests as describing how OpenStack runs a particular
service.  However, no site-specific configuration such as hostnames or
credentials should be included in these files.  This is what lets you
easily test an OpenStack project manifest on your own server.

Finally, the `manifests/site.pp` file contains the information that is
specific to the actual servers that OpenStack runs.  These should be
very simple node definitions that largely exist simply to provide
private date from hiera to the more robust manifests in the
`openstack_project` modules.

This means that you can run the same configuration on your own server
simply by providing a different manifest file instead of site.pp.

.. note::
   The example below is for Debian / Ubuntu systems.  If you are using a
   RedHat based system be sure to setup sudo or simply run the commands as
   the root user.

As an example, to run the etherpad configuration on your own server,
start by ensuring git is installed and then cloning the config Git
repo::

  sudo su -
  apt-get install git
  git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config
  cd config

Then copy the etherpad node definition from manifests/site.pp to a new
file (be sure to specify the FQDN of the host you are working with in
the node specifier).  It might look something like this::

  # local.pp
  class { 'openstack_project::etherpad':
    database_password       => 'badpassword',
    sysadmins               => ['user@example.org'],
  }

.. note::
   Be sure not to use any of the hiera functionality from manifests/site.pp
   since it is not installed yet. You should be able to comment out the logic
   safely.

Then to apply that configuration, run the following from the root of the config
repository::

  ./install_puppet.sh
  ./install_modules.sh
  puppet apply -l /tmp/manifest.log --modulepath=modules:/etc/puppet/modules manifests/local.pp

That should turn the system you are logged into into an etherpad
server with the same configuration as that used by the OpenStack
project.  You can edit the contents of the config repo and iterate as
needed.  When you're ready to propose the change for review, you can
propose the change with git-review.  See the `Gerrit Workflow wiki
article <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GerritWorkflow>`_ for more
information.

Adding a New Server
===================

To create a new server, do the following:

 * Add a file in :file:`modules/openstack_project/manifests/` that defines a
   class which specifies the configuration of the server.

 * Add a node entry in :file:`manifests/site.pp` for the server that uses that
   class.

 * If your server needs private information such as passwords, use
   hiera calls in the site manifest, and ask an infra-core team member
   to manually add the private information to hiera.

 * You should be able to install and configure most software only with
   puppet.  Nonetheless, if you need SSH access to the host, add your
   public key to :file:`modules/openstack_project/manifests/users.pp` and
   include a stanza like this in your server class::

     realize (
        User::Virtual::Localuser['USERNAME'],
     )

 * Add an RST file with documentation about the server in :file:`doc/source`
   and add it to the index in that directory.

SSH Access
==========

For any of the systems managed by the OpenStack Infrastructure team, the
following practices must be observed for SSH access:

 * SSH access is only permitted with SSH public/private key
   authentication.
 * Users must use a strong passphrase to protect their private key.  A
   passphrase of several words, at least one of which is not in a
   dictionary is advised, or a random string of at least 16
   characters.
 * To mitigate the inconvenience of using a long passphrase, users may
   want to use an SSH agent so that the passphrase is only requested
   once per desktop session.
 * Users private keys must never be stored anywhere except their own
   workstation(s).  In particular, they must never be stored on any
   remote server.
 * If users need to 'hop' from a server or bastion host to another
   machine, they must not copy a private key to the intermediate
   machine (see above).  Instead SSH agent forwarding may be used.
   However due to the potential for a compromised intermediate machine
   to ask the agent to sign requests without the users knowledge, in
   this case only an SSH agent that interactively prompts the user
   each time a signing request (ie, ssh-agent, but not gnome-keyring)
   is received should be used, and the SSH keys should be added with
   the confirmation constraint ('ssh-add -c').
 * The number of SSH keys that are configured to permit access to
   OpenStack machines should be kept to a minimum.
 * OpenStack Infrastructure machines must use puppet to centrally manage and
   configure user accounts, and the SSH authorized_keys files from the
   openstack-infra/config repository.
 * SSH keys should be periodically rotated (at least once per year).
   During rotation, a new key can be added to puppet for a time, and
   then the old one removed.  Be sure to run puppet on the backup
   servers to make sure they are updated.


GitHub Access
=============

To ensure that code review and testing are not bypassed in the public
Git repositories, only Gerrit will be permitted to commit code to
OpenStack repositories.  Because GitHub always allows project
administrators to commit code, accounts that have access to manage the
GitHub projects necessarily will have commit access to the
repositories.  Therefore, to avoid inadvertent commits to the public
repositories, unique administrative-only accounts must be used to
manage the OpenStack GitHub organization and projects.  These accounts
will not be used to check out or commit code for any project.

Root only information
#####################

Some information is only relevant if you have root access to the system - e.g.
you are an OpenStack CI root operator, or you are running a clone of the
OpenStack CI infrastructure for another project.

Backups
=======

Off-site backups are made to two servers:

 * ci-backup-rs-ord.openstack.org
 * ci-backup-hp-az1.openstack.org

Puppet is used to perform the initial configuration of those machines,
but to protect them from unauthorized access in case access to the
puppet git repo is compromised, it is not run in agent or in cron mode
on them.  Instead, it should be manually run when changes are made
that should be applied to the backup servers.

To start backing up a server, some commands need to be run manually on
both the backup server, and the server to be backed up.  On the server
to be backed up::

  ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""

And then ''cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'' for use later.

On the backup servers::

  sudo su -
  BUPUSER=bup-<short-servername>  # eg, bup-jenkins-dev
  useradd -r $BUPUSER -s /bin/bash -m
  cd /home/$BUPUSER
  mkdir .ssh
  cat >.ssh/authorized_keys

and add this to the authorized_keys file::

  command="BUP_DEBUG=0 BUP_FORCE_TTY=3 bup server",no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-pty <ssh key from earlier>

Switching back to the server to be backed up, run::

  ssh $BUPUSER@ci-backup-rs-ord.openstack.org
  ssh $BUPUSER@ci-backup-hp-az1.openstack.org

And verify the host key.  Note this will start the bup server on the
remote end, you will not be given a pty. Use ^D to close the connection
cleanly.  Add the "backup" class in puppet to the server
to be backed up.

Restore from Backup
-------------------

On the server that needs items restored from backup become root, start a
screen session as restoring can take a while, and create a working
directory to restore the backups into. This allows us to be selective in
how we restore content from backups::

  sudo su -
  screen
  mkdir /root/backup-restore-$DATE
  cd /root/backup-restore-$DATE

At this point we can join the tar that was split by the backup cron::

  bup join -r bup-<short-servername>@ci-backup-rs-ord.openstack.org: root > backup.tar

At this point you may need to wait a while. These backups are stored on
servers geographically distant from our normal servers resulting in less
network throughput between servers than we are used to.

Once the ``bup join`` is complete you will have a tar archive of that
backup. It may be useful to list the files in the backup
``tar -tf backup.tar`` to get an idea of what things are available. At
this point you will probably either want to extract the entire backup::

  tar -xvf backup.tar
  ls -al

Or selectively extract files::

  # path/to/file needs to match the output given by tar -t
  tar -xvf backup.tar path/to/file

Note if you created your working directory in a path that is not
excluded by bup you will want to remove that directory when your work is
done. /root/backup-restore-* is excluded so the path above is safe.

Launching new servers
=====================

New servers are launched using the ``launch/launch-node.py`` tool from the git
repository ``https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/config``. This tool is
run from a checkout on the puppetmaster - please see :file:`launch/README` for
detailed instructions.
