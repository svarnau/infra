Jenkins
#######

Jenkins is a Continuous Integration system that runs tests and
automates some parts of project operations.  It is controlled for the
most part by :ref:`zuul` which determines what jobs are run when.

Overview
========

A large number and variety of jobs are defined in Jenkins.  The
configuration of all of those jobs is stored in git in the
openstack-infra/config repository.  They are defined in YAML files
that are read by :ref:`jjb` which configures the actual jobs in
Jenkins.

Anyone may submit a change to the openstack-infra/config repository
that defines a new job or alters an existing job by editing the
appropriate YAML files.  See :ref:`jjb` for more information.

Because of the large number of builds that Jenkins executes, the
OpenStack project favors the following approach in configuring Jenkins
jobs:

  * Minimal use of plugins: the more post-processing work that Jenkins
    needs to perform on a job, the more likely we are to run into
    compatibility problems among plugins, and contention for shared
    resources on the Jenkins master.  A number of popular plugins
    will cause all builds of a job to be serialized even if the jobs
    otherwise run in parallel.
  * Minimal build history: Jenkins stores build history in individual
    XML files on disk, and accessing a large build history can cause
    the Jenkins master to be unresponsive for a significant time while
    loading them.  It also increases memory usage.  Instead, we
    generally keep no more than a day's worth of builds.
  * Move artifacts off of Jenkins: Jenkins is not efficient at serving
    static information such as build artifacts (e.g., tarballs) or
    logs.  Instead, we copy them to a static webserver which is far
    more efficient.

Authorization
=============

Jenkins is set up to use OpenID in a Single Sign On mode with Launchpad.
This means that all of the user and group information is managed via
Launchpad users and teams. In the Jenkins Security Matrix, a Launchpad team
name can be specified and any members of that team will be granted those
permissions. However, because of the way the information is processed, a
user will need to re-log in upon changing either team membership on
Launchpad, or changing that team's authorization in Jenkins for the new
privileges to take effect.

Devstack Gate
=============

OpenStack integration testing is performed by the devstack gate test
framework. This framework runs the devstack exercises and Tempest
smoketests against a devstack install on single use cloud servers. The
devstack gate source can be found on `git.openstack.org
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/devstack-gate>`_ and the `Readme
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack-infra/devstack-gate/tree/README.rst>`_
describes the process of using devstack gate to run your own devstack
based tests.

The :ref:`devstack-gate` project is used to maintain a pool of Jenkins
slaves that are used to run these tests.  Devstack-gate jobs create
and delete Jenkins slaves as needed in order to maintain the pool.

Sysadmin
========

Jenkins is largely hidden, and has no sensitive data exposed
publically, so we use self-signed certs for Jenkins masters.

After bringing up a jenkins node (16G memory instance if you use the
stock jenkins.default) with puppet, log in and configure Jenkins by
hand:

#. Configure the site so it knows it's correct url.
   (Jenkins URL in global config). This is needed to complete an SSO
   sign-in.

#. Configure the OpenID plugin for your SSO site (e.g. Launchpad)

#. Do not set CSRF protection - that breaks Jenkins job builder.

#. Login.

#. Setup matrix security: add the 'authenticated' pseudo user and 
   grant Admin access to your own user. 

#. Setup one account per `http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/installation.html#configuration-file`
   and grab the API token for it.

#. Configure the number of executors you want on the Jenkins Master
   (e.g. 1)

#. Configure a maven environment (if you have Maven projects to test).

#. Enable the gearman plugin globally.  Your gearman server is
   zuul.$project. If Test Connection fails, do a puppet run (puppet
   agent --test) on the zuul machine, as gearman wouldn't have started
   with no workers configured.

#. Configure the timestamper plugin. E.g. to
   '<b>'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss'</b> '

#. Enable the zmq plugin globally if it is visible. No settings were
   visible when writing this doc.

#. You will configure global scp and ftp credentials for static and
   docs sites respectively later, but as we haven't setup those sites
   yet, thats not possible :).

Puppet takes care of the rest.

Quirks
------

Note that jenkins talks to it's slaves via ssh, the
modules/openstack_project/manifests/init.pp file contains the ssh
public key that puppet installs on the slaves.

Slaves
------

Statically provisioned slaves have labels assigned by hand. E.g.
centos6, and are added to a chosen Jenkins master by hand. Adding a
slave is then:

#. Launch a slave

#. Add it to Jenkins
   Add your jenkins master key for the credentials (make it global,
   one-time operation).
   Set the jenkins home to /home/jenkins

#. Set appropriate labels on it

#. Profit!
